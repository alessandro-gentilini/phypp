This function creates a new <span class="emphasis">seed</span>. A seed is generally created at the beginning of a program, and is then used throughout to generate random numbers. Any positive integral number can be used to create the seed. The choice of this number influences which random numbers will be generated by the program. If the seed is always initialized with the same number, the program will always generate the same random values if it is executed multiple times. This is a very useful property, since the program will yield the same output regardless of when it is executed or if whether or not it is raining outside.

The seed is basically the state of the random number generator, which is chosen in all the <i>phy</i><sub>++</sub> library to be a &ldquo;Mersene twister&rdquo;. A random number generator in a given state will always generate the same random numbers, in a predictable way, even though this series of number will still be &ldquo;random&rdquo; in the sense that there will be no apparent logical connection between consecutive numbers.
<br><br>
The quality of a random number generator depends on how easy it is to figure out the link between one number and the next. The simplest generators only require a handful of operations, often including modulos and bit-wise operations, and are therefore very fast. The values they generate really appear to be random at first sight, however they usually have a relatively low period (i.e., the number of random values that can be generated until the random number generator comes back to its initial state and starts to repeat itself). This can be shown easily when generating random images, where regular patterns can be found by eye. Mersene twisters are more advanced, but they provide a very good trade off between quality and speed. In particular, they should provide random numbers of high enough quality for all physics related usages.
<br><br>
If generating random numbers happens to be one of the main performance bottleneck of one of your program, and if you can accept the loss in randomness quality, you can decide to use a faster random number generator. The C++ standard library provides several other alternatives in <div class="highlight-inline"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">#include</span><span class="cpf">&lt;random&gt;</span><span class="cp"></span></pre></div>, it is up to you to figure out the one that suits you best. You can also write your own, provided it satisfies the interface requirements. You can then use it in all the <i>phy</i><sub>++</sub> random functions in place of the usual Mersene twister. For reference, the default randomn number generator used in <i>phy</i><sub>++</sub> (the one that is returned by <div class="highlight-inline"><pre><span></span><span class="n">make_seed</span><span class="p">()</span></pre></div>) is <div class="highlight-inline"><pre><span></span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">mt19937</span></pre></div>.
