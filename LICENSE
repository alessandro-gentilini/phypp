Licence for phy++ library and tools
===================================

Note: This covers all the files present in the 'include' and 'tools' directory
  (recursively).

Note: If you enable the use of the Gnu Scientific Library (i.e. you have not
  defined the pre-processor variable NO_GSL), then the whole phy++ library is
  to be considered as GPL software, as well as your code.

Licence for CMake scripts
=========================

Note: I didn't write any of those scripts myself. They were all taken from other
  projects, each with a different licence. I am a bit worried about the GPL ones,
  since I don't know if using them implies licensing phy++ as GPL as well.
