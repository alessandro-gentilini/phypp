Pre-requisites
==============

1) You must have a recent compiler to compile C++ code. Either 'clang' (>= 3.3)
   or 'gcc' (>= 4.8) will do.

2) You must have the following libraries installed: 'cfitsio', 'CCfits',
   'wcslib', 'lapack', 'libclang'. See "Appendix: installing dependencies"
   below for instructions on how to install these libraries for different
   operating systems.

3) Installing also the 'gsl' and 'tcmalloc' libraries is recommended but not
   mandatory.

4) Installing the GNU debugger 'gdb' is recommended but not mandatory.


Install the 'phy++' library with CMake
======================================

1) Make a new directory called 'build' inside the main phy++ directory and
   navigate to it using a terminal.

2) In this directory, call 'cmake ../'. If you have properly installed all the
   required libraries, CMake will find them and configure the project
   accordingly.

3) Build the library by calling 'make'.

4) Install the library by calling 'sudo make install'.

5) As the install script suggests, you should then source the ".phypprc" file
   that was just created in your home directory so that the phy++ configuration
   is loaded in all your terminals. This can be done by adding a line in your
   ".bashrc" file containing "source /path/to/your/home/dir/.phypprc".


Veryfing installation
=====================

1) Open a new terminal so that the phy++ configuration is loaded.

2) Go to the 'test' subfolder.

3) Type 'phy++ unit_test'.

4) This should print a series of tests, eventually saying that all tests were
   passed. If this is not the case, then either the library has not been
   properly installed, or your compiler is either old or broken.


Appendix: installing dependencies (ubuntu and derivatives)
==========================================================

Installing the required libraries in ubuntu-based systems is easy. You first
need to run the following command:
  sudo apt-get install wcslib-dev libcfitsio3-dev libccfits-dev liblapack-dev

If you want, you can also install the GSL by adding 'libgsl-dev' to the above
command, tcmalloc by addind 'google-perftools', and the GNU debugger with
'gdb'.

Lastly, you will need to get a recent version of libclang.

If running ubuntu Trusty Tarh (14.04) and above:
  sudo apt-get install libclang-dev

If running ubuntu Saucy Salamander (13.10):
  sudo apt-get install libclang-3.3-dev

If running any other ubuntu distribution, the packages available in the
official repositories of ubuntu are too old. But you can still get the latest
versions from unofficial repositories. To do so, add the following two lines in
/etc/apt/sources.list:
  deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/h-rayflood/llvm/ubuntu precise main
  deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/h-rayflood/llvm/ubuntu precise main
Then run:
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install libclang-3.3-dev
You may install any other version provided it is > 3.3.


Appendix: installing dependencies (from source)
===============================================

Alternatively, you may also build all the dependencies from source. This will
take longer, and may require that you install sub-dependencies, but should work
if everything else fails.

Since the build system of all these libraries can vary, please refer to each
libraries' documentation for precise build instructions.
