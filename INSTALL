Pre-requisites
==============
1) you must have a recent version of 'clang' installed (>= 3.3) to compile C++ code
2) to be able to debug your programs, installing 'gdb' is recommended
3) you must have the following libraries installed: 'cfitsio', 'CCfits', 'wcslib', 'lapack' and
   'libclang' (ideally the same version as 'clang').


To install the 'phy++' library
=============================
1) extract all the files in this directory to any suitable location
2) add the 'bin' subdirectory to your $PATH
3) define a PHYPP_DIR environment variable holding the path to the installation directory
4) run 'make_refgen.sh'


Veryfing installation
=====================
1) go to the 'test' subfolder
2) type 'phy++ unit_test'
3) this should print a series of tests, eventually saying that all tests were passed. If this is 
   not the case, then either the library has not been properly installed, or your compiler is 
   either old or broken.
