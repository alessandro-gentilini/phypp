Pre-requisites
==============
1) You must have a recent compiler to compile C++ code. Either 'clang' (>= 3.3)
   or 'gcc' (>= 4.8) will do.
2) Installing 'gdb' is recommended but not mandatory.
3) You must have the following libraries installed: 'gsl', 'cfitsio', 'CCfits',
   'wcslib', 'lapack', 'libclang', 'llvm' and 'tcmalloc'.


Install the 'phy++' library with CMake
======================================
1) Make a new directory called 'build' and navigate to it using a terminal.
2) In this directory, call 'cmake ../'. If you have properly installed all the
   required libraries, CMake will find them and configure the project
   accordingly.
3) Build the library by calling 'make'.
4) Install the library by calling 'sudo make install'.
5) As the install script suggests, you should then source the ".phypprc" file
   that was just created in your home directory so that the phy++ configuration
   is loaded in all your terminals. This can be done by adding a line in your
   ".bashrc" file containing "source /path/to/your/home/dir/.phypprc".


Veryfing installation
=====================
1) Open a new terminal so that the phy++ configuration is loaded.
2) Go to the 'test' subfolder.
3) Yype 'phy++ unit_test'.
4) This should print a series of tests, eventually saying that all tests were
   passed. If this is not the case, then either the library has not been
   properly installed, or your compiler is either old or broken.
